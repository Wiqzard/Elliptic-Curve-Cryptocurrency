# Elliptic-Curve-Cryptocurrency

## Description
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA) used for signing transactions and validating transactions. \
Blockchain built after Bitcoins. \
Simple Peer2Peer network implementation, without use of additional libraries. \
Proof of elapsed time, i.e. if a node constructed a block, it gets assigned a waiting time after which it can submit the block to the blockchain. 

## ToDo's
1. Implement a more efficient byte conversion for transmitting data. 
2. Change method/variable names to consistent scheme. 
3. Create more exhaustive code comments.
4. Improve visibility of attributes.
5. Implement multi-threading for handling multiple clients and receiving and processing data simultaneously.
6. Improve constant variable settings.
7. Implement a local database for the blockchain.
8. Create a alpha node that assigns the waiting times.
9. Implement a Merkle-tree for block-transaction security.
